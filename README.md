# Boolfuck

My implementations of the [Boolfuck](http://samuelhughes.com/boof/index.html) Interpreter, tested thoroughly against an extensive set of test cases on [Codewars](http://codewars.com).  FreeBSD 2-Clause Licensed.

## Interpreters

Each of my implementations of the Interpreter in each language is placed in a separate folder on its own according to the name/acronym of the language.  For example, the Boolfuck interpreter in JavaScript is placed in a folder called `js`.  Each folder may or may not come with a set of test cases but note that either way, each interpreter has been thoroughly tested beforehand.
